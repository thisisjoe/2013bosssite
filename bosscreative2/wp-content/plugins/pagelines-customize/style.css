 Rules placed in this stylesheet will override the default styles of the Base Platform theme and will not be changed or over written when you update the
 Platform framework. Additionally, since this stylesheet is purely for editing purposes you can easily undo or erase some of the CSS to return your site back to the look and feel of the Base theme.

 In the Base theme the footer is black and the CSS looks like this:

 #footer {
 clear:both;
 font-size:1em;
 overflow:hidden;
 text-align: left;
 background: #000;
 color: #999;
 position: relative;
 }

 To change the background color to white, all you have to do is declare a new rule for the color like so:

 #footer { background: #FFF; }

 A great tool for modifying themes and inspecting CSS elements is the FireBug extension for FireFox. You can also use the developer tools provided by Chrome (right-click and "inspect element") or Internet Explorer if you're feeling dangerous.
